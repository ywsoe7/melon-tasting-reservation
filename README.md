# Melon Tasting Reservation Scheduler

## The app is still in progress. 

I initially wanted to build this app using Mongo for Database, Express.js and Angular to push me out of my comfort zone and try to learn new tech stack. Unfortunately, I underestimated how much time it would consume and ended up with an unfinished product. Given more time, I will first finish the app with Flask, React and PostgreSQL. I will continue to learn new tech stack I mentioned earlier and rebuild the app using Mongo, Express.js and Angular.
